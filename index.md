Welcome to the Kafadev Blog. I'm a current fourth-year university student intending on a career in software engineering, ideally in the space of Systems, AI/ML, LLM tech, or graph theory. This is a work-in-progress blog intended to document some of my progress as I learn various skills and technologies.
